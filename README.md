## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new in general, but with this challenge I had the opportunity to practice my JS skills by validating the email and also updating the DOM and realizing that I am developing a facility for this. I've also had the opportunity to continue practicing HTML and CSS, which is great.

### Continued development

I intend to continue practicing JS to develop more and more ease with all its features, as well as HTML and CSS, to create increasingly more semantic HTML and increasingly better styles.
